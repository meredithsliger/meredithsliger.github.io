## SQL + Databases

This section of my portfolio showcases database design and SQL querying experience using both relational and non-relational systems. It reflects work done across several graduate courses involving Teradata, MongoDB, and normalized schema design.

---

### üß± Data Modeling

- **[Data Modeling](/sql/data-modeling)**  
  Identifying entities, attributes, and relationships to build foundational ER and EER diagrams.

---

### üß© Schema Design

- **[Schema Design](/sql/schema-design)**  
  Logical schema structure, primary/foreign keys, and normalization through 3NF with dependency analysis.

---

### üß† SQL Querying

- **[SQL Examples](/sql/sql-examples)**  
  Real-world SQL assignments using Teradata ViewPoint covering joins, filters, aggregates, and set logic.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Advanced Topics

- **[Data Warehousing](/sql/data-warehousing)**  
  Understanding dimensional modeling and ETL pipelines.

- **[NoSQL & Big Data](/sql/nosql)**  
  Exploring schema-less systems, document modeling (MongoDB), and Big Data infrastructure.

---

Each topic page includes examples, formatted SQL code, relational diagrams, and normalized schema models to demonstrate practical data engineering and querying skills across a variety of database environments.
