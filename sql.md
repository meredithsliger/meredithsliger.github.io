## SQL + Databases

This section of my portfolio showcases database design and SQL querying experience using both relational and non-relational systems. It reflects work done across several graduate courses involving Teradata, MongoDB, and normalized schema design.

---

### üß± Data Modeling

- **[Conceptual Modeling](/sql/conceptual-modeling)**  
  Identifying entities, attributes, and relationships to build foundational ER diagrams.

- **[EER & Mapping](/sql/eer-modeling)**  
  Designing enhanced ER diagrams (EER) and mapping them into relational models.

- **[Relational Schema Design](/sql/relational-model)**  
  Building logical schema structures with clearly defined keys and relationships.

- **[Normalization](/sql/normalization)**  
  Organizing attributes into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.

---

### üß† SQL Querying

- **[SQL Examples](/sql/sql-examples)**  
  Real-world SQL assignments using Teradata ViewPoint with grouped examples covering joins, aggregates, and multi-table queries.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Advanced Topics

- **[Data Warehousing](/sql/data-warehousing)**  
  Understanding dimensional modeling and ETL processes used in data warehouses.

- **[Big Data & NoSQL](/sql/big-data)**  
  Exploring Big Data architecture, distributed systems, and schema-less alternatives.

- **[MongoDB](/sql/mongodb)**  
  Practicing document-based queries and updates using MongoDB and JSON structures.

Each topic page includes detailed examples, formatted SQL code, relational diagrams, and normalized schema models to demonstrate practical data engineering and querying skills across a variety of database environments.
