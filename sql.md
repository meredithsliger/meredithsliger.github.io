## SQL + Databases

This section of my portfolio highlights the SQL and data modeling skills I've developed through graduate coursework. From foundational concepts like ER diagrams and normalization to querying large-scale databases using Teradata and MongoDB, this work reflects a comprehensive understanding of relational and non-relational database systems.

### üß± Data Modeling

- **[Conceptual Modeling](/sql/sql-conceptual-modeling)**  
  Identifying entities, attributes, and relationships to construct early-stage ER diagrams.

- **[EER & Mapping](/sql/sql-eer-modeling)**  
  Working with enhanced ER models and converting them into relational schemas.

- **[Relational Schema Design](/sql/sql-relational-model)**  
  Defining primary and foreign keys, enforcing integrity constraints.

- **[Normalization](/sql/sql-normalization)**  
  Applying 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to reduce redundancy and improve schema efficiency.

### üß† SQL Querying & Practice

- **[SQL Basics](/sql/sql-query-basics)**  
  Writing `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `UPDATE` queries on single tables.

- **[Joins](/sql/sql-joins)**  
  Combining data from multiple tables using INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT joins.

- **[Subqueries & Aggregates](/sql/sql-subqueries-aggregates)**  
  Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and nested queries to perform grouped summaries.

- **[Teradata Practice](/sql/sql-teradata)**  
  Hands-on SQL practice in a Teradata ViewPoint environment.

### üóÑÔ∏è Advanced Topics

- **[Data Warehousing](/sql/sql-data-warehousing)**  
  Exploring dimensional modeling and warehouse architecture.

- **[Big Data & NoSQL](/sql/sql-big-data)**  
  Learning core concepts of Big Data, Hadoop, and NoSQL alternatives.

- **[MongoDB Hands-On](/sql/sql-mongodb)**  
  Performing document-based operations and queries using MongoDB and JSON.
