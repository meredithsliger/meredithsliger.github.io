## Python Projects

This section highlights my applied work in Python, combining foundational programming skills with real-world data tasks, optimization, and analysis. These projects demonstrate fluency in Python syntax, core data structures, and the ability to solve problems using libraries like `pandas`, `math`, and `BeautifulSoup`.

---

### üß† Programming Fundamentals

- **[Python Basics](/python/python-basics)**  
  Focused on expressions, variables, types, Boolean logic, and basic I/O operations.

- **[Strings, Lists, Tuples](/python/python-data-structures)**  
  Explored indexing, slicing, and the use of immutable and mutable data structures.

- **[Control Structures](/python/python-control)**  
  Implemented `if`, `elif`, `else`, and various looping patterns.

- **[User-Defined Functions](/python/python-functions)**  
  Wrote reusable functions with scope, parameters, returns, and documentation.

- **[Standard Library & Math Module](/python/python-standard-library)**  
  Utilized built-in functions and external libraries to perform mathematical operations and string formatting.

---

### üìÅ Data Handling & I/O

- **[File Handling & Exceptions](/python/python-file-io)**  
  Read from and wrote to files, processed lines, and implemented error handling with `try/except`.

- **[2D Lists & Nested Loop Patterns](/python/python-nested-loops)**  
  Developed logic for working with matrix-style data structures and multi-level iteration.

---

### üîß Optimization & Problem Solving

- **[Linear Programming in Python](/python/python-lp)**  
  Modeled optimization problems using techniques covered across multiple chapters, with a focus on formulating objective functions and constraints.

---

### üìä Data Analysis & Visualization

- **[pandas Foundations](/python/python-pandas)**  
  Used `pandas` to manipulate, filter, group, and summarize structured data.

- **[pandas Foundations ‚Äì Part 5](/python/python-pandas-5)**  
  Applied advanced operations, merging datasets, and explored relationships across multiple data sources.

---

### üåê Web Data Collection

- **[Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup & pandas](/python/python-web-scraping)**  
  Extracted and cleaned data from websites using BeautifulSoup, then processed it with `pandas` for analysis.

Each subpage includes code, analysis, and concepts demonstrating how I‚Äôve used Python to solve problems across domains such as optimization, data wrangling, and automation.
