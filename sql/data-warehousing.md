### 📄 Tableau Prep: Employee Data Integration

- [🗂️ ETL Assignment Instructions (DOCX)](/assets/sql/Tableau_Prep_Assignment.docx)

The assignment walks through a realistic HR scenario:
- Merging address and payroll data from different files
- Creating new derived fields (e.g., bonus, new salary, years employed)
- Filtering to include only active employees
- Standardizing inconsistent values (e.g., gender, state codes)

The flow concludes by:
- Joining the tables on Employee ID
- Aggregating by city for analysis
- Exporting the output to a `.hyper` file for use in Tableau

This example illustrates real-world data transformation tasks often required before data can be analyzed or loaded into a warehouse.
