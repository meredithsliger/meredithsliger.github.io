## ☁️ NoSQL & Big Data

This section focuses on document-oriented databases and non-relational data models, emphasizing flexibility, scalability, and real-world use cases with MongoDB.

---

### 🧾 MongoDB Concepts & Practice

Hands-on work with MongoDB using JSON-style documents included:
- Creating and querying collections
- Updating nested fields
- Using comparison and logical operators (`$gt`, `$and`, etc.)
- Controlling projection to limit returned fields

📌 Example Topics Covered:
- Display only specific fields (e.g., `first name`, `age`) from nested student documents
- Filter by age ranges (e.g., students aged 22–26)
- Use of `_id` exclusion when not needed in output

### 💡 NoSQL Characteristics

- Schema-less data structure (JSON-like documents)
- Horizontally scalable
- Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data
- Frequently used in real-time applications and data pipelines

This section demonstrates practical experience with one of the most widely used NoSQL technologies and provides context for when to use document-based storage versus relational databases.
