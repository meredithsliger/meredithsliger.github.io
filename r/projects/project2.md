# Project II: Poisson vs Linear Model

This project investigates how the choice of statistical model affects inference and prediction when analyzing count data.

Using species richness data, the project compares:

- **Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression**

Key concepts demonstrated:

- GLM assumptions and link functions
- Model selection and fit assessment
- Overdispersion checks
- Comparison of predictions between Poisson and linear models

This project serves as a practical application of choosing models based on data distribution and interpretation goals.
