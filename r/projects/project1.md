# Project I: Gala & Faculty Salaries

This project applies multiple linear regression and model selection techniques to two datasets:

- **GalÃ¡pagos Islands Species Richness**: Explores predictors of species count such as island size and isolation.
- **Faculty Salaries**: Models salary data by rank, discipline, years of service, and other factors.

Key methods applied include:

- Multiple linear regression
- Log transformation and Box-Cox transformation
- Stepwise model selection using AIC/BIC
- Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for nonlinear relationships
- Hypothesis testing and diagnostics
