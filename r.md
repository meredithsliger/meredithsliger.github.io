## R Projects & Topics

As part of my graduate coursework in Data Science and Analytics, I've worked extensively in R for statistical modeling, data exploration, and experimental design. This section highlights select projects and topics — ranging from linear models and model selection to forecasting and spatial statistics.

### 📘 Introductory Regression

These early projects focus on understanding linear relationships, building predictive models, and performing diagnostics using real-world datasets.

- [Simple Linear Regression](/r/introductory-regression-models/intro-regression) – Used trend data from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to fit and interpret a simple linear model  
- [Multiple Linear Regression](/r/introductory-regression-models/multiplelinearregression) – Modeled housing prices and body composition using multiple predictors  
- [Model Selection & Diagnostics](/r/introductory-regression-models/model-selection) – Applied best subset, AIC, BIC, and residual checks for model refinement

### 📈 Advanced Modeling Techniques

This section explores more complex models, including nonlinear regression, nonparametric smoothing, and regularization.

- [ANCOVA](/r/advanced-regression/ancova) – Incorporated categorical and continuous variables in a unified framework  
- [Nonparametric Methods](/r/advanced-regression/nonparametric) – Fitted loess, splines, and GAMs to model nonlinear patterns  
- [Shrinkage Methods](/r/advanced-regression/shrinkage) – Applied Ridge and Lasso to improve model generalizability

---

### 🧪 Experimental Design

Hands-on labs with designed experiments, covering concepts like randomization, blocking, and factorial structure.

- [Randomized Designs](/r/experimental-design/randomized-designs) – Compared treatment groups using CRD and ANOVA  
- [Blocked & Factorial Designs](/r/experimental-design/block-factorial) – Investigated interaction effects in multifactor studies

---

### ⏱️ Time Series & Forecasting

Modeled time-dependent data to identify structure and predict future observations.

- [Time Series Analysis](/r/time-series/time-series) – Decomposed trends and estimated ARMA models  
- [ARIMA & Forecasting](/r/time-series/arima-models) – Performed ARIMA model selection and evaluation

---

### 🌍 Spatial Statistics

Analyzed spatial datasets using exploratory tools and spatial models to understand location-based structure.

- [Spatial Analysis](/r/spatial/spatial-analysis) – Investigated spatial autocorrelation and variograms  
- [Spatial Models](/r/spatial/spatial-models) – Applied kriging and Gaussian processes for prediction

---

### 🧪 Featured Projects

Capstone-style coursework projects integrating regression, model diagnostics, and advanced statistical methods.

- [Project I: Gala & Faculty Salaries](/r/projects/project1) – Explored model selection, transformations, and GAMs across two real-world datasets  
- [Project II: Poisson vs Linear Models](/r/projects/project2) – Compared GLM and OLS models for count data with emphasis on assumptions and prediction

Each subpage includes summaries, code, visuals, and key takeaways. These projects reflect my growing skillset in applying R to real-world analytical problems across a variety of domains.
