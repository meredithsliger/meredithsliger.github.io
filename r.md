## R Projects

As part of my graduate coursework in Data Science and Analytics, I've worked extensively in R for statistical modeling, data exploration, and experiment design. This section highlights select projects and topics I've studied — ranging from regression analysis to time series forecasting and spatial statistics.

### 📊 Regression & Modeling

These projects involved fitting and evaluating various statistical models using real-world data. I focused on model interpretation, diagnostic checking, and comparisons between methods.

- [Multiple Linear Regression](/r/multiple-linear-regression) – Built models to estimate and predict outcomes using continuous and categorical variables
- [ANCOVA](/r/ancova) – Combined regression and ANOVA to adjust for covariates
- [GLM](/r/glm) – Applied logistic and Poisson regression for binary and count data
- [Nonparametric Methods](/r/nonparametric) – Used loess and spline methods where assumptions of linearity were not appropriate
- [Shrinkage Methods](/r/shrinkage) – Explored regularization (Ridge, Lasso) to improve model performance and interpretability

### 🧪 Design of Experiments

These assignments focused on structuring and analyzing controlled experiments. I learned how design decisions impact the reliability of results and how to handle complex experimental setups.

- [Design of Experiments](/r/design-of-experiments) – Core principles like randomization, blocking, and replication
- [Randomized Designs](/r/randomized-designs) – Simple CRDs with treatment comparisons
- [Blocked & Factorial Designs](/r/block-factorial) – Multi-factor setups and interaction analysis
- [Mixed Models & Computer Experiments](/r/mixed-models) – Simulated experiments and hierarchical modeling

### ⏱️ Time Series Analysis

These projects involved analyzing patterns in time-dependent data. I worked on identifying trends, modeling seasonality, and generating forecasts.

- [Time Series Analysis](/r/time-series) – Explored autocorrelation, lags, and stationarity
- [ARIMA & Forecasting](/r/arima-models) – Built ARIMA models and validated their predictive accuracy

### 🌍 Spatial Statistics

This section showcases exploratory and model-based analysis of spatially structured data. I applied geostatistical tools to assess spatial patterns and build predictive models.

- [Spatial Analysis](/r/spatial-analysis) – Measured spatial dependence and structure
- [Spatial Models](/r/spatial-models) – Applied kriging and Gaussian Process modeling for interpolation

I’ve included summaries on each subpage, with links to code, visuals, and relevant coursework. These projects reflect my evolving ability to apply R to practical analytical challenges across a range of data types.
