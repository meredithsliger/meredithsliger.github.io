# 🗻 National Parks Attendance Trends

## 🔍 Why This Project?

As someone who deeply values nature, conservation, and accessible outdoor spaces, I’ve long been interested in how public use of national parks reflects broader societal trends. From rising ecotourism to the surge in outdoor recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic, national park visitation tells a story—not just of travel habits, but of public engagement with the natural world.

In this project, I aim to:
- Quantify changes in park visitation over time
- Explore the impact of events like the pandemic on travel behavior
- Forecast future trends in park attendance using time series models
- Help inform potential questions around funding, staffing, and conservation resources in high-traffic parks

The analysis blends **personal curiosity** with **real-world relevance**—forecasting how visitation may evolve is valuable for both policymakers and park planners.
